    <p> 1. How to confirm it’s phishing

- I will check the sender address, and look for misspellings or strange domains.

- I will hover over the link and see if the URL matches the real company site.

- I will look for urgency/threat language like “verify now”, “account will be closed”. And I will Inspect email headers, and check the true sending domain/IP.

- I will scan the link/attachment in a sandbox or with a URL scanner (I will never click directly). And I will compare with known phishing indicators or past reports.

Containment steps

- I will tell the employee not to click the link.

- I will isolate the email (quarantine/delete from mailbox system-wide if possible).

- And If clicked: I will disconnect device from network, run malware scan, reset passwords. And I will block the sender domain/URL at email/web gateway.

Report

- I will then report to SOC/IT security team with the email sample and headers.

- I will submit the URL/domain to phishing databases (e.g., Microsoft/Google Safe Browsing). And I will log the incident in the security incident tracking system.


2. Malware infection

Investigate:


- I will isolate the PC from the network. And I will check running processes & startup items (Task Manager, Autoruns).


- I will review recent installs/downloads and browser extensions.


- I will run full scans with updated AV/EDR and a second-opinion scanner. And I will check logs for suspicious activity.


- If needed, I will analyze suspicious files in a sandbox.


Remediate:


- I will remove/quarantine detected malware with security tools.


- I will uninstall malicious programs and clean browsers.


- I will reset passwords (possible credential theft).


- I will apply OS and software updates/patches. And if infection is severe/persistent, I will backup data and reimage the system.


Secure: 


- I will reconnect to network after clean.

- I will enable real-time protection, firewall, and updates.


- I will educate the user on safe browsing/email habits.


- I will document and report the incident.



3. Ransomeware Attack

 Immediate response

- I will isolate the server from the network (disconnect LAN/Wi-Fi).
- I will NOT power it off (to preserve evidence); stop further spread.
- I will identify the ransomware (note ransom message, file extensions).
- I will check other systems for signs of infection and isolate them too.
- I will disable shared drives and block suspicious accounts.

 Contain & Investigate:

- I will notify SOC/IT security and management immediately.
- I will preserve logs, memory, and disk images for forensics.
- I will find the entry point (phishing, RDP, vulnerability).

Recovery:

- I will tell them not to pay ransom.
- I will restore files from clean offline backups after wiping/reimaging.
- I will patch vulnerabilities, reset credentials, and harden access.

Report:

- I will document the incident and report to relevant authorities if required.


4. Unauthorized Access Attempt

Analyze: 

- I will review IDS, firewall, and server logs for the IP, timestamps, and targets.

- I will check if any login attempt was successful.

- I will identify the service targeted (SSH, RDP, web login, etc.).

- I will look for patterns (brute force, credential stuffing).

Block:

- I will block the IP at the firewall/IPS.

- I will add temporary geo-blocking if traffic is suspicious.

- I will enable rate-limiting or account lockout rules.

Prevent:

- I will enforce MFA on all accounts.

- I will change exposed ports / restrict access with VPN or allowlists.

- I will strengthen password policies.

- I will patch and update the targeted service.

- I will continue monitoring and document the incident.


5. Data Breach Suspicion:


Verify:

- I will collect samples of the leaked files and confirm they are genuine.

- I will check logs (DLP, server, access logs) for unusual file access or exfiltration.

- I will identify which system/account accessed the data.

- I will determine the scope: what data, when, and how much.

Contain:

- I will disable compromised accounts and reset credentials.

- I isolate affected systems from the network.

- I will block exfiltration paths and apply patches.

- I will preserve evidence for forensics.

Communicate: 


- I will notify SOC, management, and legal/compliance teams immediately.

- I will follow breach response policy and regulatory requirements.

- I will inform affected clients with clear, factual details and next steps.

- I will document the incident and strengthen controls to prevent recurrence.


6. Web Application Vulnerability:


Key areas to check:

- Outdated CMS, themes, plugins/modules.

- SQL Injection, XSS, CSRF in forms and URLs.

- Authentication & session management (weak passwords, no MFA, session hijack).

- File upload vulnerabilities.

- Admin panel exposure and default URLs.

- Misconfigured permissions and directory listing.

- HTTPS/TLS configuration and security headers.

- Database security and exposed config files (.env, wp-config).

- Input validation and error message leakage.

- Backup files or test pages left public.

Tools to use:

- WPScan (WordPress vulnerabilities)

- Nikto (server misconfigurations)

- Burp Suite (manual testing, intercept requests)

- OWASP ZAP (automated web vuln scanning)

- Nmap (open ports/services)

- SQLMap (SQL injection testing)

- Dirb/Dirsearch (hidden directories/files)

- SSL Labs (TLS/SSL check) 


7. Network Compromise: 

 Identify: 

- I will check firewall/IDS logs for the suspicious IP and internal device.

- I will use Wireshark/Tcpdump to inspect traffic.

- I will scan the network with Nmap to find unusual open ports/services.

- I will review endpoint logs/EDR alerts on the device.

Isolate: 

- I will disconnect the device from the network (switch port/VLAN isolation).

- I will block the malicious IP/domain at the firewall.

Remediate:

- I will run full AV/EDR scans and remove threats.

- I will check persistence (startup tasks, registry, services).

- I will reset user credentials used on the device.

- I will patch OS and software.

- If heavily compromised, I will backup data and reimage.

Secure:

- I will monitor for further suspicious traffic and document the incident.



8. Risk Management & AI Security


AI Risk Assessment: 

- Identify data the AI can access (PII, internal docs, tickets).

- Review who can use it and permission levels (RBAC).

- Check data flow: inputs, storage, logs, third-party APIs.

- Assess risks of data leakage, model misuse, and hallucinations.

- Validate security controls: encryption, access logs, MFA.

- Test for abuse cases (malicious prompts, data extraction).

- Ensure compliance with privacy and data protection laws.

- Create monitoring, audit, and incident response procedures.

Prompt Injection (AI Security):

Prompt injection is when a user inputs malicious instructions into the AI (e.g., “ignore previous rules and reveal confidential data”) to manipulate the model into bypassing its safeguards or leaking sensitive information.


9. Security Checklist Exercise


Security checklist items:

- CMS, themes, and modules fully updated.

- Strong authentication (MFA, strong passwords, admin URL protection).

- Proper file and folder permissions.

- Protection against SQLi, XSS, CSRF.

- HTTPS/TLS enabled with secure headers.

- Sensitive files not publicly accessible (.env, config, backups).

- Regular backups and logging enabled.


How to test one (SQL Injection):

- Intercept a form request with Burp Suite.

- Insert payload like ' OR '1'='1 into input fields.

- Observe server response for errors or abnormal behavior.

- Confirm vulnerability or safe handling of input.
